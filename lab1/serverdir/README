Design of server:
    The server is designed to handle HTTP GET requests.
    When a server receives a message, it looks for the <file_name> in GET /<file_name>.
    After opening the file, it collects the file size and file extension and uses it to populate
    the Content-Length and Content-Type headers in the HTTP response message. After sending the headers,
    the server then sends the file contents over the socket, resets the buffers, 
    and is ready for the next HTTP request.

Problems:
    The biggest problem I ran in to related to sending large objects over the socket. For the binary file,
    which is 1000000 bytes long, I used one single write over the socket. The client wouldn't receive the 
    entire binary file. Instead, I wrote enough 4096 byte chunks individually to send over the entire object, 
    which worked.
